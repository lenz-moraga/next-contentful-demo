## 1. Backend/API Layer

- ~~Scaffold an `api` folder for a Node.js/Express server.~~

- ~~Add middleware (logging, error handling, authentication).~~
- Integrate Next.js API routes for server-side logic.

## 2. State Management

## 4. Testing

- Install Jest and React Testing Library.
- Write unit and integration tests for components and API endpoints.

## 5. Styling Variety

- Add SASS/LESS files for components.
- Use Bootstrap for forms or modals.

## 6. CI/CD

- Add a `.github/workflows` file for GitHub Actions.
- Set up lint/test/build workflow.

## 7. Cross-Browser Debugging

- Test in Chrome, Firefox, Edge.
- Document findings in `README.md`.

## 8. Code Review & Improvements

- Add error handling to API calls.
- Use TypeScript interfaces for API responses.
- Improve accessibility with ARIA attributes and semantic HTML.
- Use React Suspense for data fetching.
- Add JSDoc comments for functions.
